# alm-scraper

a cli program for scraping the data from Application Lifecycle Manager, an absolute dogshit application that Deloitte makes us use for tracking bugs in our business transformation project, and dumping it into, idk, markdown files or something.

## problem statement

well the major problem with this piece of shit website is that you can't actually link to anything. so if someone says "hey check out defect 993", I have to navigate to the dumb website and find it myself like a god damn 12th century peasant.
